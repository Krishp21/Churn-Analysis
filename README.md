# Customer Churn Prediction Using SQL Server, Power BI & Python  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **customer churn prediction** using **SQL Server for data processing, Power BI for visualization, and Python (Random Forest) for predictive modeling**. The dataset undergoes **ETL, data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering**, followed by **machine learning-based churn prediction** and **interactive Power BI dashboards** for insights.  

## Key Features  
- **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Processed raw data using **SQL Server** for structured analysis.  
- **Power BI Dashboards:** Created **interactive reports** to visualize churn trends, demographics, contract types, and key churn factors.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Developed a **Random Forest-based churn prediction model** achieving:  
  - **85% Accuracy**  
  - **87% Precision (Non-Churn Customers)**  
  - **78% Precision (Churn Customers)**  
- **Business Insights:** Identified **high-risk customers** and key factors influencing churn, supporting **data-driven decision-making**.

 ## Structure
- **Churn_Prediction.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation metrics, and churn predictions.
- **Churn_Analysis.pbix** – Power BI file showcasing churn analysis, predictive insights, and data-driven visualizations. (Access through URL - https://app.powerbi.com/links/tb8Uq4Qe_X?ctid=b87386c8-9083-4a27-9ddf-63a3dfa33850&pbi_source=linkShare )
